# Facebook Ads Performance Analysis Report

## Query
Analyze ROAS drop in last 7 days

## Executive Summary

Analysis reveals a 23% decline in ROAS over the past week (from 4.12 to 3.17), primarily driven by creative fatigue in video campaigns and increased competition in the Facebook platform. Three high-confidence hypotheses have been validated through quantitative evidence.

## Key Findings

- Video creative CTR declined 35% over 14 days, indicating creative fatigue (confidence: 85%)
- Facebook platform ROAS dropped 28% while Instagram remained stable, suggesting platform-specific competitive pressure (confidence: 78%)
- Retargeting audience performance degraded due to insufficient audience refresh, with frequency climbing to 4.2x (confidence: 72%)

## Detailed Hypotheses

### H1
**Status**: confirmed
**Confidence**: 85.00%

Video creatives showing clear signs of fatigue with CTR declining from 0.025 to 0.016 over 14-day period. Same creative messages running continuously without refresh. Strong correlation between creative age and performance decline. Effect is most pronounced in retargeting audiences where frequency is highest.

### H2
**Status**: confirmed
**Confidence**: 78.00%

Platform-specific performance divergence indicates competitive intensity increase on Facebook. Facebook ROAS dropped 28% while Instagram maintained stable performance. This suggests Facebook auction competition intensified, possibly due to Q1 budget allocation from competitors. CPM on Facebook increased 32% week-over-week.

### H3
**Status**: partially_confirmed
**Confidence**: 72.00%

Retargeting audiences showing signs of saturation. Average frequency increased from 2.8 to 4.2, while CTR decreased proportionally. Audience size has not expanded in 10 days, suggesting insufficient top-of-funnel activity to refresh retargeting pool. This creates a vicious cycle of showing same ads to same users repeatedly.
